# Theory for rate model estimations in **_statstruk_**

## Introduction
The **_statstruk_** package is based on standard statistical theory and that described in the Norwegian document: [Bruk av applikasjonen Struktur](https://www.ssb.no/a/publikasjoner/pdf/notat_200730/notat_200730.pdf). A summary of the theory used in programming **_statstruk_** is described here.

The package can be used to calculate model-based estimates for totals ({math}`T`) of a target variable collected from sampled units ({math}`s`) in a population ({math}`U`)). Standard and robust estimates for the uncertainty (variance) of the estimates are also calculated in the package. The methods provided are common for business surveys at Statistics Norway.

There are 3 common models used for estimating: rate, regression and homogenous models. Rate model estimation is describes here.

## Rate model estimation
Estimates based on a rate model are based on the following model:

```{math}
y_{hi} = \beta_h x_{hi} + \epsilon_{hi}
```

where \(y_{hi}) is the variable of interest for unit {math}`i` in stratum {math}`h`, {math}`\beta_h` is the rate for the stratum, {math}`x_{hi}` is the explanatory variable, and {math}`\epsilon_{hi}` is the residual.

The variance structure of the residuals for a rate model is

```{math}
Var(\epsilon_{hi}) = x_{hi}\sigma^2_h
```

### Total estimation
The value for {math}`\beta_h` is estimated using:

```{math}
\hat{\beta}_h = \frac{y_{s_h}}{x_{s_h}}
```

where {math}`y_{s_h}` is the sum of the variable of interest for the sample in stratum {math}`h` and {math}`x_{s_h}` is the sum of the explanatory variables for the sampled units in stratum {math}`h`.

The estimate for the total ({math}`T_h`) in stratum {math}`h` is:

```{math}
\hat{T}_h = X_h \hat{\beta}_h
```

where {math}`X_h$ is the sum of the explanatory variable in stratum {math}`h` for the population.


### Standard variance estimation
A standard estimation for the uncertainty of the total estimate ({math}`\hat{T_h}`), for a rate model, can be described as

```{math}
\hat{Var}(\hat{T}_h-T_h) = X_h^2 \frac{X_h-x_{s_h}}{X_h} \frac{\hat{\sigma}_h^2}{x_{s_h}}
```

where {math}`\hat{\sigma}_h^2` is estimated from the model as

```{math}
\hat{\sigma}_h^2 =\frac{1}{n_h-1}\sum_{i\in s_h}\frac{(y_{hi} - \hat{\beta_h}x_{hi})^2}{x_{hi}}
```

Furthermore, the standard error ({math}`SE`) is

```{math}
SE(\hat{T_h}-T_h)= \sqrt{\hat{Var}(\hat{T_h}-T_h)}
```

and the coefficient of variation ({math}`CV`) is then

```{math}
CV(\hat{T_h}-T_h) = \frac{SE(\hat{T_h}-T_h)}{\hat{T_h}}
```

### Robust variance estimation
The [Struktur application](https://www.ssb.no/a/publikasjoner/pdf/notat_200730/notat_200730.pdf) programmed in SAS also includes  robust variance estimation. Three of these are programmed in the **_statstruk_** package. These are summarized in this section.

We define the robust variance estimate for a rate model in two parts:

```{math}
Var_{robust}(\hat{T}_h-T_h) &= Var(\sum_{i \notin s_h}\hat{y}_{hi}) + Var(\sum_{i \notin s_h}y_{hi}) \\
&=\frac{X_{h|s_h}}{x_{s_h}}^2 \sum_{i\in s_h}{d_{hi}}+ \frac{X_{h|s_h}}{x_{s_h}} \sum_{i\in s_h}{d_{hi}}
```


where {math}`X_{h|s_h}` is the sum of the explanatory variable in stratum {math}`h` excluding the sum of those in the sample in that stratum ({math}`s_h`). The variable {math}`d_{hi}` is then defined in the following ways:

```{math}
Var_{robust1} &: d_{hi} = e_{hi}^2 \\
Var_{robust2} &: d_{hi} = \frac{e_{hi}^2}{1-hat_{hi}} \\
Var_{robust3} &: d_{hi} = \frac{e_{hi}^2}{(1-hat_{hi})^2}
```


where {math}`e_{hi}` is the residual of observation {math}`i` in the model in stratum {math}`h` and {math}`hat_{hi}` is the {math}`i`th value of the diagonal from hat matrix, defined for a rate model as

```{math}
hat_h=W_h^{1/2}X_h(X_h^TW_hX_h)^{âˆ’1}X_h^TW_h^{1/2}
```

where {math}`W_h` is the vector of weights which is {math}`1/X_h` for a rate model.



### Domain estimation
We are often interested in estimating totals that are not only at the strata level. If domains are simply aggregated strata we can estimate the total for domain, {math}`d` as

```{math}
\hat{T}_d = \sum_{h \in d}\hat{T}_h
```

Similarly the variance can also be summed to calculate the uncertainty of the domain estimates

```{math}
\hat{Var}(\hat{T_d}-T_d) = \sum_{h \in d}\hat{Var}(\hat{T_h}-T_h)
```

If the domains are not aggregations of several strata, we need to adjust the estimates for the total and uncertainty to account for this. The estimate of the total ({math}`T_{hd}`) for domain, {math}`d`, in stratum, {math}`h`, is

```{math}
\hat{T}_{hd} = X_{hd}\hat{\beta}_h
```

and a total for the domain ({math}`\hat{T}_d`) as

```{math}
\hat{T}_{d} = \sum_h \hat{T}_{hd}
```

A standard variance for the domain estimate can be calculated by first the variance of the strata domains as

```{math}
\hat{Var}(\hat{T}_{hd} - T_{hd}) =  X_{hd|s_h}^2\frac{X_{hd|s_h} + x_{s_h}}{X_{hd|s_h}} \frac{\hat{\sigma}_h^2}{x_{s_h}}
```

where {math}`X_{hd|s_h}` is the sum of the explanatory variable in the population for strata {math}`h`, and domain {math}`d`, excluding the {math}`x` values in the sample for that domain and stratum. The total for the domain is the sum over the strata as

```{math}
\hat{Var}(\hat{T}_{d} - T_{d}) = \sum_h \hat{Var}(\hat{T}_{hd} - T_{hd})
```

## Outlier detection
Estimation based on models can be strongly influenced by outliers that have a strong influnce on the model estimates. The **_statstruk_** package provides two outlier detection metrics: studentized residual values and the difference of fits values (DFFITS or G).

### Studentized residuals
The studentized residuals ({math}`t_{hi|i}`) are calculated using an estimate for {math}`\sigma_h` based on a fitted model without observation, {math}`i`, and is sometimes referred to as the external studentized residuals. The studentized residuals are calculated as

```{math}
t_{hi|i} = \frac{y_{hi} - \hat{\beta_h}x_{hi}}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}_{h|i}^2x_{hi}}\sqrt{1-hat_{hi}}}
```
where

```{math}
\hat{\sigma}_{h|i}^2 = \frac{1}{n_h-2}\sum_{j\ne i}\frac{(y_{hj}-\hat{\beta}_{h|i}x_{hj})^2}{x_{hj}}
```

where {math}`\hat{\beta}_{h|i}` refers to the model estimate for the rate excluding observation {math}`i`.
Absolute values of the studentized residual values above a criteria are then classified as outliers. A general threshold criteria used in **_statstruk_** is  2 but can be adjusted.

### DFFITS
The difference of fits ({math}`G`) can be calculated from the studentized residuals and hat values as

```{math}
G=t_{hi|i} \sqrt{\frac{hats_{hi}}{1 - hats_{hi}}}
```
Absolute values of {math}`G` above a specified threshold are classified as outliers. The thresold value used for outlier values of {math}`G` in rate models is generally {math}`\lambda \sqrt{1/n_h}` where {math}`\lambda` is often set to 2 but can be adjusted.
